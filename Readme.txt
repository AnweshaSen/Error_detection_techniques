Build Instructions:
1. Make sure cmake is installed. If not, on ubuntu based distros:
        $ sudo apt install cmake
2. Then run the shell script "build_and_run.sh" using:
        $ bash build_and_run.sh

If no CMake available, simply run "bash no_cmake_compile_run.sh", which will compile the program and the run it. The executable will be available in build directory.
